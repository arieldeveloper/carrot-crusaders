<h1>Carrot Crusaders</h1> 
<p>Made for my Grade 12 Media Arts class, Carrot Crusaders is a Space Invaders inspired game with added features such as powerups, 
mystery enemies, cool animations and bonus double bullet ability when fully evolved. Artwork was created by my partner. Created using pygame and python version 3.6</p>
